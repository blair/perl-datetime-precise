Package DateTime::Precise version 0.02

This is the DateTime::Precise package.  This module provides for the
representation and manipulation of (almost) arbitrary locations in
time.

DateTime.pm is not intended to be a replacement for any of the
existing Date:: or Time:: modules, but you may find it useful as a
supplement.  Notable features:

  * Date and time can include fractional seconds.

  * Date is represented internally by an array of year, month, day,
    hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of seconds.  Using this
    method, dates as far back as the start of the Gregorian
    calendar) can be used.

  * Methods are provided for doing date/time calculations.
    Increment and decrement, as well as round, floor and ceil
    functions by unit (second through year) are provided, as well as
    simple date-difference operations.

  * Methods are provided for input from and output to user-specified
    formats (dprintf, dscanf, get_time, set_time, strftime).

This module is based on the DateTime module written by Greg Fast
(gdfast@usgs.gov).

REQUIREMENTS

   * Perl 5.004_04 or greater.
