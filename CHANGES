	* Release version 1.04.

Tue Aug 28 13:14:01 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* README: Update Blair Zajac's email address to
	  blair@orcaware.com.  Remove reference to the Caltech FTP
	  site for a secondary repository of Blair Zajac's Perl
	  modules.
	* lib/DateTime/Precise.pm: Update Blair Zzajac's email address
	  to blair@orcaware.com.

Tue Aug 28 12:34:15 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* lib/DateTime/Precise.pm: The $VERSION variable was being set
	  using

	  $VERSION = substr q$Revision: 1.04 $, 10;'

	  which did not properly set $VERSION to a numeric value in
	  Perl 5.6.1 probably due to the trailing ' ' character after
	  the number.  This resulted in 'use DateTime::Precise 1.03'
	  failing to force Perl to use version 1.03 or newer of
	  DateTime::Precise even if 1.02 or older was installed
	  because $VERSION was set using substr and Perl would not
	  consider $VERSION to be set.  Now use the longer but
	  effective:

	  $VERSION = sprintf '%d.%02d', '$Revision: 1.04 $' =~ /(\d+)\.(\d+)/;

	* Release 1.03.

Sun Jun 10 18:54:44 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> (Blair Zajac) 
 
	* lib/DateTime/Precise.pm: Try to import Time::HiRes::time to
	  load a high resolution time.  Fix a bug when the time was
	  modified using seconds() and the time had previously a
	  non-zero fractional second component.  The previous
	  fractional seconds would be included in a sum with the
	  argument to seconds().  Now reset the fractional part of the
	  time to 0 before using the seconds() argument.
	* t/01date_time.t: Reorder a test to ensure that the above bug
	  in seconds() is checked.

Thu Feb 22 20:37:22 PST 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Release 1.02.

Thu Feb 22 20:27:46 PST 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Fix a bug where if 0 is passed to an increment or decrement
	function, then it would actually increment the time by 1 unit.
	Check for a defined value instead of a non-0 or non-'' value.

Wed Jan 31 15:24:17 PST 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Release 1.01.

Wed Jan 31 15:09:10 PST 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Fix a bug where a \s was not being properly added to a regular
	expression.  This also fixes the 'Unrecognized escape \s
	passed through at Precise.pm line 1483' warning when using
	Perl 5.6.0.

Thu Apr  8 10:20:30 PDT 1999 <blair@geostaff.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Have ok() in t/*.t return the success or failure of the
	test instead of the number of tests performed.

	Release 1.00.

Thu Oct 22 09:11:09 PDT 1998 <blair@orcaware.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Fix a bug in new() where it wouldn't correctly set the time
	using the one argument form of time.  This bug found by
	Joe Pepin <joepepin@att.com>.

	Fix some spelling mistakes.

	Release 0.04.

Sun Jun 28 11:56:40 PDT 1998 <blair@orcaware.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Add dscanf('%u') which loads GMT time into the object.  This is to
	complement dscanf('%U') which loads local time into the object.

	Update the POD to reflect the change in dscanf.

	Change test #8 to use %u instead of %U so the test will succeed
	in any timezone.

	Release 0.03.

Fri Jun 26 16:57:37 PDT 1998 <blair@orcaware.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Add a new jday() method that returns day_of_year() - 1.

Fri Jun 26 15:06:52 PDT 1998 <blair@orcaware.com> (Blair Zajac)

	New() didn't properly initialize the underlying representation
	of DateTime::Precise before it was passed off to set_time().
	Add a new test to cover this case.

	Update the POD a little.

	Release version 0.02.

Mon Jun 22 13:46:03 PDT 1998 <blair@orcaware.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Add a new method copy, which creates a new copy of an
	existing DateTime::Precise object.  Use copy to create
	copies of times instead of new and clone.  Add tests for
	copy.

	Add comparison test between integer and fractional times.

Sun Jun 21 12:05:38 PDT 1998 <blair@orcaware.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Have overloaded neg operator state the class of the offending
	object instead of DateTime::Precise.

	Have all of the set_* methods return the newly set object if
	the set was successful, undef otherwise.

Thu Apr 24 12:00:00 PDT 1998 <blair@orcaware.com> (Blair Zajac)
