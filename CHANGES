	Fix a bug in new() where it wouldn't correctly set the time
	using the one argument form of time.  This bug found by
	Joe Pepin <joepepin@att.com>.

	Fix some spelling mistakes.

	Release 0.04.

Sun Jun 28 11:56:40 PDT 1998 <blair@gps.caltech.edu> (Blair Zajac)

	Add dscanf('%u') which loads GMT time into the object.  This is to
	complement dscanf('%U') which loads local time into the object.

	Update the POD to reflect the change in dscanf.

	Change test #8 to use %u instead of %U so the test will succeed
	in any timezone.

	Release 0.03.

Fri Jun 26 16:57:37 PDT 1998 <blair@gps.caltech.edu> (Blair Zajac)

	Add a new jday() method that returns day_of_year() - 1.

Fri Jun 26 15:06:52 PDT 1998 <blair@gps.caltech.edu> (Blair Zajac)

	New() didn't properly initialize the underlying representation
	of DateTime::Precise before it was passed off to set_time().
	Add a new test to cover this case.

	Update the POD a little.

	Release version 0.02.

Mon Jun 22 13:46:03 PDT 1998 <blair@gps.caltech.edu> (Blair Zajac)

	Add a new method copy, which creates a new copy of an
	existing DateTime::Precise object.  Use copy to create
	copies of times instead of new and clone.  Add tests for
	copy.

	Add comparison test between integer and fractional times.

Sun Jun 21 12:05:38 PDT 1998 <blair@gps.caltech.edu> (Blair Zajac)

	Have overloaded neg operator state the class of the offending
	object instead of DateTime::Precise.

	Have all of the set_* methods return the newly set object if
	the set was successful, undef otherwise.
